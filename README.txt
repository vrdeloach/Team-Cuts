	Ultimate Fades Barbershop README
=======================================

Hello! Our names are Kaitlyn Hardin and Zarek Robertson and we are "Team Cut". This is our website for Ultimate Fades Barbershop.

When beginning the website creation, we did not know we would eventually be working as a team on this. After we began to work together, we realized our work improved drastically when working on the same website. Initially, the website was chosen when one of our members asked a sibling which barber shop they preferred. This eventually led to us creating a website for a barber shop that deserved credit for the haircuts it had styled on its customers.

When thinking of the design of our website, we decided to make it simple to navigate and easy to read. Through this image, we made the color of the site white and blue, and included a small amount of red to accommodate for the widely-known "barber's pole", which can be seen on the homepage picture. We chose our font based on the "easy-to-read" part of our design vision. We believe that it looks stylish but is narrow enough to be seen by people looking to read quickly.

Our footer was the part of our website that we had the most trouble with. Overall, it looks basic enough that it does not draw attention from the main attractions of the webpages, but is filled with enough information so that you can find what you need and navigate the website easily.

--------------
   Homepage
--------------

- Our homepage is meant to introduce the website, and have a general summary of what the other pages have on them.
- We decided to have the location and a picture in case people wanted to see a picture just before leaving to find the barbershop.

--------------
    About
--------------

- Here, we can see the owners/master barbers of the shop.
- This page is to talk about the barbershop in more detail and explain how they care for their customers.

--------------
    Service
--------------

- This page is for the services that the shop provides and the pricing for each of them.
- We added a chart to make the page look more organized and colorful. Also, we tried to recreate the colors of the barber's pole onto the rows of the chart.

--------------
    Styles
--------------

- We wanted to show what the styles looked like, in case the customer was unaware of how they would look afterwards.
- There is a border around the pictures to add a part of the website style to them, and we used these to make them blend with the color styling of the website.

--------------
 Testimonials
--------------

- After asking the opinion of the customers what they thought about the barbershop, we added this page to show what others thought of the hairstyles they left with.
- The comments were originally in a vertical layout down the page, but we eventually changed it to a more condensed layout.

--------------
   Contact
--------------

- On this page, we wanted to make sure that everyone could have a way to contact each of the barbers. 
- It is also extremely easy to find the location and methods of contact through the map and links provided.

==============
 Entire Site
==============

- Overall, we wanted to make a site that was attractive and useful so that anyone that wanted to get their hair in style could easily find the place to go to.
